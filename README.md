This is a guide to setup the LayerSeven service into a client such as TiViMate or another. It does cover the basics on equipment, app setup and few other things. It will never have everything in it as there is about 100 IPTV clients out there and just as many devices.

The intro covers what it is, how not to be scammed. Then into equipment and how to subscribe/pay.
Followed up by internet, VPNs, EPGs and more.
